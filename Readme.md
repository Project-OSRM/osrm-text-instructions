# OSRM Text Instructions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions)

----

OSRM Text Instructions transforms [OSRM](http://www.project-osrm.org/) route responses into localized text instructions. This repository contains the canonical implementation of this library written in JavaScript. OSRM Text Instructions is also available [in Swift and Objective-C](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions.swift/) and experimentally [in Java](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-java/tree/master/mapbox/libjava-services/src/main/java/com/mapbox/services/api/navigation/v5/osrm/).

OSRM Text Instructions has been translated into [several languages](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions/tree/master/languages/translations/). Please help us add support for the languages you speak [using Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/project-osrm/osrm-text-instructions/).

### Design goals

- __Cross platform__ Use a data-driven approach that makes implementations in other programming environments easy to write
- __Test suite__ Have a data-driven test suite with fixtures which can be used cross-platform
- __Translation__ Allow for translations via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/project-osrm/osrm-text-instructions/)
- __Customization__ Users should be able to easily fork or monkey-patch the results to adjust to their own liking

### JavaScript Usage

```js
var version = 'v5';
var osrmTextInstructions = require('osrm-text-instructions')(version);

// make your request against the API, save result to response variable

var language = 'en';
response.legs.forEach(function(leg) {
  leg.steps.forEach(function(step) {
    instruction = osrmTextInstructions.compile(language, step, options)
  });
});
```

parameter | required? | values | description
---|----|----|---
`version` | required | `v5` | Major OSRM version
`options.hooks.tokenizedInstruction` | optional | `function(instruction)` | A function to change the raw instruction string before tokens are replaced. Useful to inject custom markup for tokens
`language` | required | `en` `de` `zh-Hans` `fr` `nl` `ru` [and more](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions/tree/master/languages/translations/) | Compiling instructions for the selected language code.
`options` | optional | Object with 2 keys: `legIndex` and `legCount`, both having integer values. Used for giving instructions for arriving at waypoints.

### Development
#### Architecture

- `index.js` holds the main transformation logic in javascript
- `instructions/` holds the translateable strings

#### Tests

Tests are data-driven integration tests for the english language.

To run them yourself for the JavaScript implementation:

```
npm install
npm test
```

##### Generate Fixtures

Fixtures are programatically created and updated via `test/fixtures_test`. To update the instructions in the fixture files, run `UPDATE=1 npm test`. To create new fixtures, add them to `test/fixtures_test`, then run `UPDATE=1 npm test`.

#### Translations

The main language of this project is English `en`. We support other languages via translations, as seen in [`languages/translations`](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions/tree/master/languages/translations/).

You can help translating on the web via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/project-osrm/osrm-text-instructions/)

To add an own translations:

- Go to [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/project-osrm/osrm-text-instructions/) and create the new translation there
- When the translation on Transifex is ready, pull in the translation file:
  - Create an empty translation file `echo "{}" > languages/translations/{language_code}.json`
  - Add the new translation file and language code to `./languages.js`
  - If needed: make overrides in `languages/overrides/{language_code}.json`
  - `npm run transifex`
- Generate fixture strings for the tests via `UPDATE=1 npm test` (see changes in `git diff`)
- Make a PR

#### Release

- `git checkout master`
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Bump version in package.json
- `git commit -am "vx.y.z"` with Changelog list in commit message
- `git tag vx.y.z -a` with Changelog list in tag message
- `git push origin master; git push origin --tags`
- `npm publish`
